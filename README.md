## Clean Architecture Showcase

Welcome to this repository where clean architecture principles come to life!
## Overview

This project demonstrates a practical application of clean architecture, incorporating design patterns like mediator, CQRS, and DDD.
It aims to serve as a reference for implementing these concepts in real-world applications.
## Key Features

Clear Separation of Concerns: Enforces a well-defined boundary between domain logic, infrastructure, and presentation layers.
Enhanced Testability: Promotes easier unit testing by isolating components and reducing external dependencies.
Improved Maintainability: Facilitates code changes and updates without impacting other parts of the system.
Enhanced Flexibility: Enables easier adaptation to evolving requirements and technologies.
## Technologies Used

Frameworks/Libraries:

. Entity Framework
. Mediator
. FluentValidation
. Mapster

Programming Languages:
.net 8, c#

Databases:

Sql server

## Project Structure

Domain: Contains core business logic and entities, independent of external concerns.
Infrastructure: Handles external interactions like database access, messaging, and UI.
Application: Orchestrates domain logic and interacts with the infrastructure layer.
Presentation (optional): Contains UI components or API endpoints for user interaction.
